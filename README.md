# ExplosionLib for Rigs of Rods
Have you ever wanted to blow something up in Rigs of Rods? This AngelScript module allows you to do so!
## What can i do with this?
Explosions with customisable power, duration, whenever you want to. While this is mostly made for modders to create working explosives, you can just copy explosionlib and it's example(s) to Rigs of Rods's scripts folder and blow up stuff randomly.
## Limitations
- ExplosionLib doesn't and will never provide explosion video/sound effects. You will have to add those manually.
- ExplosionLib applies it's forces to nodes, not to triangulations, thus it's effect fully depends on the vehicle's nodes/weight ratio.
- It might cause some lag.
- Currently, slow motion and lag heavily affects it.
